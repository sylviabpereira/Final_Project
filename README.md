#### The dataset used for this project:
Kuzilek J., Hlosta M., Zdrahal Z. Open University Learning Analytics dataset Sci. Data 4:170171 doi: 10.1038/sdata.2017.171 (2017).

#### Research Questions:

In this project, I will use association analysis to:
1) Understand learners' behavior in the Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) and discover common usage patterns.
2) Identify the learners' interactions with the VLE materials that correspond to the resultant "pass" or "fail".

#### Dataset contains these files:

#### studentinfo.csv:

This file contains demographic information about the students together with their results. The original file contains 12 columns.

#### studentVle.csv:

The studentVle.csv file contains information about each studentâ€™s interactions with the materials in the VLE. The original file contains 6 columns.

#### vle.csv:

The vle.csv file contains information about the available materials in the VLE. Typically these are html pages, pdf files, etc. Students have access to these materials online and their interactions with the materials are recorded. The vle.csv file contains 6 columns.

The three datasets were combined.
